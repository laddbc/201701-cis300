* the effective diffusion coefficient is defined as:

\[D_e = \frac{D_{AB} \phi_p \sigma_c}{\tau}\]

** where $D_{AB}$ is the normal gas phase diffusivity
** \phi_p is the pellet porosity (void volume / total volume)
** \sigma_c is the constriction factor, which is ratio of the smallest radius in the pores to the largest radius
